# Case Study SBRU
A Case Study about Spring Breaks 'R' Us (SBRU) which is an online travel service that books spring break trips to resorts for college students.

Spring Breaks ‘R’ Us (SBRU) is an online travel service that books spring break trips to resorts for college students. Students have booked spring break trips for decades, but changes in technology have transformed the travel business in recent years. SBRU moved away from having campus reps with posted fliers and moved to the Web early on. The basic idea is to get a group of students to book a room at a resort for one of the traditional spring break weeks. SBRU contracts with dozens of resorts in the key spring break destinations like Florida, Texas, the Caribbean, and Mexico. Its website shows the information on each resort and includes prices, available rooms, and special features. Students can research and book a room, enter contract information, and pay deposits and final payments through the system. SBRU provides updated booking information, resort information updates, and travel information for booked students when they log in to the site.

The resorts also need access to information from SBRU. They need to know about their bookings for each week, the room types that are booked, and so forth. Before the spring break booking season starts, they need to enter information on their resorts, including prices and special features. Resorts need to be paid by SBRU for bookings, and they need to be able to report and collect for damages caused by spring breakers during their stay.
SBRU has recently decided to upgrade its system to provide social networking features for students. It is currently researching possibilities and collecting information from prospective customers about desirable features and functions. From the business standpoint, the idea is to increase bookings by enhancing the experience before, during, and after the trip.

1. Who are the stakeholders for SBRU? For each type of stakeholder, what aspects of the SBRU booking system are of particular interest?
2. What are the main functional requirements for the major subsystems?
3. Describe some usability requirements for students, booking interactions, and social networking interactions.
4. Assuming that social networking at the resorts will require wireless communication and connection to the Internet, what are some reliability requirements that resorts might be asked to maintain? What are some performance requirements? Is this a bigger issue because resorts are in international locations?
5. What are some security requirements? Are there any reasons why students in Europe, Asia, or other locations could not book rooms through SBRU? What issues might be anticipated?
6. To collect information on functional requirements for the social networking subsystem, what are some techniques that might be used?
7. Using any Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram, document the SBRU current workflow.
